# Personal learnings

## 1. Using Sass

I've always seen people use Sass but I thought it was redundant and not worth it. After using it,I'm certain that I won't go back to writing css anymore. Sass provides so many cool features that make your workflow much smoother and more productive. Definitely will be using sass from now on.

## 2. Ajax

I think that learning Ajax and understanding how it works is really important. It's a skill every developer should know. I found it pretty easy to wrap my head around. Overall, it's a skill definitely worth learning.


## 3. CSS3-based animations

CSS3 animations are getting better and better everyday. They are very powerful and once you learn how they work you can create pretty cool animations. I feel like I've been getting better with animations.

# My notes about the project

The project was a good learning experience overall. I learned how to use APIs, get data from them and use them in my website. I developed my Sass skills as well. Like I said, I really think Sass is the way to go, since it has a lot of cool features one can use. This project was a perfect example of a grid layout which helped me strengthen my CSS3 grid skills. The stretch goal was good too. It helped me learn more about CSS3 animations.
